# discord-faucet-bot
discord bot for faucet

This project was designed for the Chia blockchain Testnet environment. It is a Discord bot that will watch for Discord messages and once it finds a "/faucet" command and a valid TXCH wallet address, it will call the XCH Dev API to make a request on the Discord users's behalf.

This site helped with getting the bot setup in Discord: [How to Create a Discord Bot to Download Midjourney Images Automatically: Python Step-by-Step Guide](https://medium.com/@neonforge/how-to-create-a-discord-bot-to-download-midjourney-images-automatically-python-step-by-step-guide-3e76d3282871) 

This site helped with setting up the code as a service on Ubuntu: [Setup a python script as a service through systemctl/systemd](https://medium.com/codex/setup-a-python-script-as-a-service-through-systemctl-systemd-f0cc55a42267)
